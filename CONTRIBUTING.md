# Contributing to FlaUI-MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FlaUI-MCP!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/FlaUI-MCP.git`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes
6. Push and create a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- .NET SDK 8.0+ (used as the build tool)
- .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack (targeting pack)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Building

```powershell
cd src/FlaUI.Mcp
dotnet build
```

The same build can be run from GitHub Actions with the **Build** workflow's
manual dispatch button. Pull requests and pushes to `net48` also run the build.

### Releasing

This is the **.NET Framework 4.8** release line, maintained on the long-lived
`net48` branch (it is not merged back into `main`). Releases are created by the
**Release** workflow. Maintainers can either push a `-net48` semantic version tag
such as `v0.1.1-net48`, or run the workflow manually and provide the tag name.
Manual releases default to draft so the generated `FlaUI-MCP-*-net48.zip` can be
reviewed before publishing. Periodically sync `main` into `net48` (one-way) to
absorb upstream fixes.

### Testing

```powershell
# Unit tests
dotnet test tests\FlaUI.Mcp.Tests

# Desktop integration tests; requires an interactive Windows session
dotnet test tests\FlaUI.Mcp.IntegrationTests

# In another terminal, test with a JSON-RPC request
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}' | dotnet run --project src/FlaUI.Mcp
```

## Code Style

- Use C# conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private)
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small
- Prefer async/await for I/O operations

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **One feature per PR** - Keep PRs focused
2. **Update documentation** - If you add a feature, document it
3. **Add tests** - When applicable
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add your changes under "Unreleased"
